# RTS Group Movement

I am <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sandra-alvarez-45453215b/">Sandra Alvarez</a>, student of the <a href="https://www.citm.upc.edu/ing/estudis/graus-videojocs/">Bachelor’s Degree in Video Games by UPC at CITM</a>. This content is generated for the second year’s subject Project 2, under supervision of lecturer <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/ricardpillosu">Ricard Pillosu</a>.

NOTE: although this research focuses mainly on real-time strategy (RTS) games, the methods described can easily be applied to games from other genres.

Intro to the subject
Moving troops in groups via complex terrain is a challenge that many games have to deal with, specially real-time strategy games, where hundreds of units compete for the same destinations. The main question is, how do we make units cooperate with each other, so they move around without causing a terrible chaos? Here is, then, where coordinated movement comes in.

Coordinated movement is the result of combining two different techniques. The first one is pathfinding, while the second one is movement.

Different approaches by different games

Description in detail for the selected approach
How do we avoid them lining up?
How do they finish the path? (avoid all to the same spot)
